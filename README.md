# OOP Hierarchical State Machine (HSM) Framework for C++

This project is an implementation of UML statecharts/HSM written for C++.
It provides a framework for writing object-oriented state machines where each
state is represented by its own class.  Most operations (e.g., transitions) use
constexpr and templates.

## Features

* Each state represented by a class

* Helper macros to simplify creation of boiler-plate code
